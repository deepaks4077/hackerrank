==========

These are my solutions to the problems on hackerrank.com.

I will try to commit on a daily basis. 

Please dont expect model answers but yeah I will commit only when I know that I have the right answer. Hackerrank always tells you when you have the right answer, your solution needs to pass all of their testcases.

No specific language each problem comes with its own list of languages you can solve it with. I will primarily use Java.
